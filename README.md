Recomendations
--------------

For better code interaction and visualization we recommend the [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/mars1) IDE.
For testing the application we highly recommend the [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/) Android emulator because of it's stability and useful features, along with it's the eclipse [plugin](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/developers/user-guide#genymotion-plugin-for-eclipse).

Usage
-----

You may import the folder ```Game2d``` into eclipse as an existing Java project and set it's dependencies on libraries of Java Build Path. After that you can run your project as ```Android Application```.

You can use Genymotion to test the app, or you can run on an Android (4.0.3 or higher) Smartphone directly connect to the computer.

This creates the default executable:

```bash
.. Game2d/bin/Game2d.apk
```

Witch you can install later on your Android Smartphone.
